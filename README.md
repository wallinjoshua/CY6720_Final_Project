# Predicting U.S. High School Student Graduation Outcomes Using Two Longitudinal Studies

## Project Abstract
High Schools in the United States, as well as state and federal education agencies, have a vested interest in ensuring that students graduate on time. Often, individual schools and districts have limited resources to support students that are at risk of failing, and look to identify these students early-on, with the hope of remediating any educational issues before they lead to a negative outcome. In this project, we focus on a public dataset tracking high school students from 2002 to 2004. We extract features from these datasets and build a model to predict whether or not a student in 10th grade will later graduate ontime (i.e., at or before Spring 2004). We apply various techniques to simplify this model and improve its accuracy in the presence of imbalanced classes. Finally, we attempt to apply the model to data from a similar longitudinal study beginning in 2009.
